# Soldering-first-steps-
my first soldering experience. I hope it will be useful to those who have never used soldering before  

## The basics.  

In my case, the soldering temperature was about 300-310 degrees Celsius.  

It is important to use glasses and a protective mask to protect the respiratory tract and eyes from solder and harmful fumes. In ideal conditions, a hood is required.  

The main principle of soldering is the use of a more fusible metal than the ones we want to solder.  

Between soldering sessions, you need to put the soldering machine in a special holder.  In my case, it was a stand with a large metal spring.  

Before soldering, we treat the surfaces with flux – it is needed to remove the oxide film from metals.  

The flux is an acid. If left alone, it can contribute to the development of corrosion over time. To avoid this, you need to use alcohol to treat the surface after soldering. In our case, there was a napkin soaked in isopropyl alcohol.  

## A learning task.  

Installation of LEDs in a special kit with a keychain. The set includes a keychain with holes on the inner surface of which metal circles are located; 2 LEDs, 2 transistors; a battery pack; a battery for a watch.  

## Beginning.  

We choose a suitable soldering nozzle / tip in shape and size.

## Flux.  

We treat the surfaces for soldering with flux.

## Fixation.  

We fix the parts for soldering. In our case, we used a special holder called the "third hand". To avoid its displacement during operation, we fixed this holder with an additional holder to the desktop itself.

## We install the LED.  

We install it so that the long leg goes through the "+” hole. We bend the wire so that its different ends do not come into contact with each other and with other metal surfaces.  

We position our hands so that we can simultaneously hold the solder coil and position the soldering iron correctly.

## Soldering.  

We apply the soldering iron tip to the desired surfaces and wait 2-3 seconds for them to heat up. Then we apply the tip of the solder wire as close as possible to the tip of the soldering iron. Be careful, the solder dissolves very quickly! We wait 1-2 seconds for a drop of solder to appear. Then we first remove the solder coil, then remove the soldering iron so that a drop of solder gets on the desired surfaces.  

Repeat the required number of times. Then cut off the excess wire. In my case, I used wire cutters. 



## We evaluate the result.  
Install the battery with the flat side to the side opposite the surface of the keychain in the battery holder. The LEDs should blink.  

I did not make sure that the transistor was tightly pressed against the keychain before soldering and one of them protrudes strongly from the front surface of the keychain.
Despite this, the task was completed.

**Important addition:** on the first day of soldering, I used a hot glue gun to protect the soldering points. This is not an ideal solution, but it can be useful in some situations. For example, when you are not sure about the quality of the work you have done.
